# InternConnect – Internship & Job Opportunity Portal

InternConnect is a **MERN stack web application** designed for college use to simplify the sharing of internship and job opportunities.

In many colleges, placement updates are sent via multiple emails, which often leads to confusion and missed opportunities. **InternConnect solves this by providing a single centralized portal** where all internship and job postings can be viewed and managed easily.
